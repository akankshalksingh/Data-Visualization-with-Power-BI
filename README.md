# Data Visualization with Power BI
### I have created Power BI dashboard using the Maven Analytics dataset to improve data-driven decisions and my ability to see the big picture.

To get the data I have used Maven Analytics - https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground 

### Pizza Place Sales

The following are the process I used in the analysis to enhance the operations of Plato's pizza restaurant:
1. Finding key metrics
2. Used MYSQL to run queries and create joins within the given tables and make relevant tables according to the requirement.
3. Importing files into Power BI and using DAX measures for finding numerical results.

Key Findings:
1. July Month has got the most number of orders within the year.
2. The Thai Chicken Pizza is the best-selling pizza
3. Classic Pizza is the most selling pizza
